Ok so it's a day late, sorry about that. Got a friend up from Adelaide,
a few vids of a new English chief (Jamie Oliver), had a couple of brews
decided to try out a recipe...and well the food was good, (abit fatty for
a Sydney pallete), and the brews keeped coming and damn those Scotts for
single mult whisky.

Anyway back to it.

1. Ok you should have a few gif89 files. Copy to C:\Windows\System and    register, (don't copy the zip right, for newbies).

   Drop down to DOS 

   cd to c:\windows\system

   and Type in followed by return

   Regsvr32 gif89.dll.

2. Make a directory (good idea if testing a new bit of code), and copy the vb    project stuff into it

3. Run the project, (written in vb5) to see the effect. Have not done          anything complex just a demo and the control.

4. The gifs came from an internet site, www.animfactory.com.

If you want to create stuff try Unlead Cool 3D, cheap even here in Oz under
$100 dollars. No l am not an employee of this company, just enjoy their
product. Hmm version 3 has been released...Computer Super Store here l come.


Any problems email me at jeff.ritchie@fujitsu.com.au in the next four weeks
anyway, the joys of contracting.


Nice to talk to ya!!!!!!!!!
